7/20: DOM,SVG, &amp; Events - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This game requires you to select a letter to figure out a hidden word in a set amount of chances.

It manipulates an SVG image, generates random words, displays the words in a UI, shows incorrect letters, notifications when selecting letters twice, and shows popups when you win or lose.
You can also reset the game to play again.

This is the 7th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
